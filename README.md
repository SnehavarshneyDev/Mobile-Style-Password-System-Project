## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **Mobile-Style Password System** built using **C++**, where users can create a password similar to what is found in mobile phones. The system lets users:
- Choose between **PIN**, **Pattern**, or **Alphanumeric** passwords
- Verify their password to unlock the system
- Reset password using a **secret code** if forgotten

---

## 🔐 Features
- Choose from 3 password types: PIN / Pattern / Alphanumeric
- Simple **Unlock** and **Forgot Password** options
- **Reset option** with a verification key
- Realistic mobile experience in a console environment

---

## 🧠 How it Works
1. User selects password type
2. Creates and saves a password
3. Can unlock with password or reset it if forgotten
4. Reset requires verifying a secret key (`code123`)
